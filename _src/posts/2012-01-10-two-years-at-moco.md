If I remember right, today is my two year anniversary working full time at Mozilla. And it works out to about six years of working with Mozilla and [TC39](http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC39.htm). I could stop and get sentimental, but [there's work to do](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:proposals).
