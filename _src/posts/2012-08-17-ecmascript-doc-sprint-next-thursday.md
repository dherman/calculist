I've been working on a [reboot to the ECMAScript web site](https://github.com/dherman/tc39-codex-wiki) lately, which you can preview at [tc39wiki.calculist.org](http://tc39wiki.calculist.org). One of the most important parts of this will be a set of [high-level descriptions of the proposals for ES6](http://tc39wiki.calculist.org/es6/).

We will be hosting a **virtual doc sprint** to work on these pages next **Thursday, August 23rd**. If you enjoy writing documentation or coming up with bite-sized example programs to demonstrate new language features, please join us! A few of us will be on US Eastern time, so starting around 9 - 10am UTC-5, and others will be coming online on US Pacific time, around 9am UTC-8. You're welcome to join us for any part of the day.

We'll be hanging out all day in the `#jsdocs` channel on [irc.mozilla.org](http://irc.mozilla.org). Hope you can join us!
