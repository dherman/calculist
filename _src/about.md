# About

<img class="about right" src="/img/profile.jpg" /> My name is Dave Herman. I'm a Principal Researcher and founder of Mozilla Research, where we are working to expand the foundations of the Open Web. I participate in a number of Web platform projects, including:

- [task.js](http://taskjs.org)
- [sweet.js](http://sweetjs.org)
- [asm.js](http://asmjs.org)
- [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org)
- [Servo](https://github.com/mozilla/servo/)
- Parallel JS

I also participate in open standards, in particular as a representative on [TC39](http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC39.htm), the committee that standardizes JavaScript.
