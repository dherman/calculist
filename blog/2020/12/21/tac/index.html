<h2 id="declare-and-forget">Declare and forget</h2>

<p>Volta’s lead maintainer, <a href="https://github.com/charlespierce">Chuck Pierce</a>, likes to say that his favorite compliment is when Volta users tell him they tend to <a href="https://twitter.com/mitsuhiko/status/1332088775330054145">forget it exists</a>.</p>

<p>Just like how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code">Infrastructure as Code</a> frees teams from manually managing their server infrastructure, Volta lets a team collectively maintain descriptions of their project’s required tools right in their git repo. On a day-to-day basis, developers just use the tools they’re familiar with—calling Node, npm, Yarn, and other CLI tools directly from the command-line or scripts, without ever even thinking about installing or upgrading.</p>

<h2 id="why-dont-you-just">Why don’t you just…?</h2>

<p>I’m not claiming Volta is the first or only TaC solution. In fact, it was inspired by other systems like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup">rustup</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv">rbenv</a>. But sometimes people ask why we even need toolchain managers when you could just use containers or cool new cloud-based development environments like <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">Codespaces</a>.</p>

<p>Cloud development environments are the future, but I think they still end up wanting a TaC solution. For example, in a monorepo environment, it’s not always enough to have just one version of Node or other tools installed. It should be easy to move around from sub-project to sub-project without constantly having to install or modify the system tools.</p>

<h2 id="my-hope">My hope</h2>

<p>Just like Go set a new standard that languages should come with <a href="https://blog.golang.org/gofmt">their own auto-formatter</a>, I think rustup planted a seed that programming platforms should also come with their own tool manager. My hope for JavaScript is that eventually Node will ship with a tool manager similar to or even based on Volta.</p>

<p>Even better? Maybe some day all major programming platforms will treat TaC as table-stakes functionality, just like code formatting and package management.</p>

<h2 id="see-for-yourself">See for yourself!</h2>

<p>If you’ve never tried using a tool manager before, <a href="https://volta.sh">Volta 1.0</a> is out today, so now’s a great time to try it for yourself!</p>
