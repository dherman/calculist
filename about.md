<img class="about right" src="/assets/profile.jpg" /> My name is Dave Herman. I've served on [TC39](http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC39.htm), the standards committee responsible for evolving JavaScript, since 2006, and founded [Mozilla Research](http://research.mozilla.org) in 2011. At Mozilla, I advised and contributed to the development of [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org), the parallel browser engine [Servo](http://servo.org), [asm.js](http://asmjs.org), and [WebAssembly](http://webassembly.org). I've recently joined LinkedIn's build tools team, where I'm looking at finding new ways to help developers dare to be ambitious.
