I'm joining the throngs of programmer-bloggers using [Octopress](http://octopress.org) for my new blog.
There's so much to commend about it, but it really comes down to one thing:

_Programmers should be able to write their blogs in text editors._

Also, from now on, everything I ever do in my life should be in GitHub.
